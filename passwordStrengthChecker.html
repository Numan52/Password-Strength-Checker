            <h2>How To Create Secure Passwords</h2>
            <p>The best practices for creating secure passwords are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A password should be 16 characters or more; our password-related research has found that 45 percent of Americans use passwords of eight characters or less, which are not as secure as longer passwords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A password should include a combination of letters, numbers, and characters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A password shouldn't be shared with any other account.
                </li>
                <li>
                     A password shouldn't include any of the user's personal information like their address or phone number. 
                    It's also best not to include any information that can be accessed on social media like kids' or pets' names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A password shouldn't contain any consecutive letters or numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A password shouldn't be the word “password” or the same letter or number repeated.
                </li>
            </ul>

                        There's no one password that is the “most secure”, and if there was, 
                        to write it here would make it insecure, as thousands of people would use it on their accounts. 
                        Rather, secure passwords contain a seemingly random combination of numbers,
                        letters and symbols and include at least 16 to 20 characters.

                    <div class="answer">
                        A 12 character password is somewhat secure; however, the most secure passwords are 16 to 20 characters long.

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are long passwords more secure?</button>
                    <div class="answer">
                        Long passwords are more secure than short passwords. 
                        We recommend using passwords that are anywhere from 16 to 20 characters long,
                        although nearly half of Americans use passwords of eight characters or fewer.
